      <p>
        Bettina Szili is 20 years old. I designed the appearance and layout of
        this page. I have always been passionate about creativity and design.
        Working on this project was an exciting challenge for me. I also love
        animals and enjoy spending time with them. I have a dog and three cats,
        and they are a big part of my life. Taking care of them brings me a lot
        of joy. In my free time, I like to explore new design ideas and improve
        my skills. I believe that good design makes a big

      <p>
        I was the one who made the database for this project. I'm a proud owner
        of three dogs: two males, Bruno and Szundi(wich means 'snooze' in
        english) and a female named suzy. Bruno is a puli (a hungarien dog
        breed), Szundi is a mixed breed and lastly, suzy is a miniature
        daschund. I'm a dog owner since I was 13-14 years old and I've always
        had a passion for animals. I had a lot of animals since than
        outdoors/inside alike. I had hamsters, pigeon,fish, dogs and cats. I
        can't imagine life without them.

      <p>
        Ever since I was a kid, I've always cared deeply about animals. One
        time, I met a sick dog and took care of him, so when they took him to
        the shelter, he was already looking healthier. I'm always sensitive when
        it comes to animals ,so of course, I'm always thinking of ways to help
        them. What better way to do that than by helping them find a loving
        home? I hope all three of us can be of help with that. if you have any
        questions, feel free to ask me! I myself have two lovely animals: one
        brooding cat named hercules and one funny little daschund named prince.
