    <p>
      I was the one who made the database for this project. I'm a proud owner of
      three dogs: two males, Bruno and Szundi(wich means 'snooze' in english)
      and a female named suzy. Bruno is a puli (a hungarien dog breed), Szundi
      is a mixed breed and lastly, suzy is a miniature daschund. I'm a dog owner
      since I was 13-14 years old and I've always had a passion for animals. I
      had a lot of animals since than outdoors/inside alike. I had hamsters,
      pigeon,fish, dogs and cats. I can't imagine life without them.

      Ever since I was a kid, I've always cared deeply about animals. One time,
      I met a sick dog and took care of him, so when they took him to the
      shelter, he was already looking healthier. I'm always sensitive when it
      comes to animals ,so of course, I'm always thinking of ways to help them.
      What better way to do that than by helping them find a loving home? I hope
      all three of us can be of help with that. if you have any questions, feel
      free to ask me! I myself have two lovely animals: one brooding cat named
      hercules and one funny little daschund named prince.
